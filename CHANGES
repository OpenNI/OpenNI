Version 1.5.4.0 (Unstable version - May 7th 2012)
-------------------------------------------------
  * Gadget: now also notifies about SUSPEND state.
  * Implemented xnUSBRegisterToConnectivityEvents() in Linux (partial - only detects disconnection).
  * Bug Fix: NiCRead sample didn't work (redist problem).
  * Bug Fix: when recording, the first two frames might have timestamp 0 (though image is different).
  * Gadget: writing is now performed using a queue. WriteEndpoint() is no longer blocked. Performance is much better!
  * .Net wrapper bug fix: can't create production nodes of new types.
  * XnBitSet: adding GetDataSize() method.
  * Fixed the Android makefiles.
  * Removed the 10K max depth limit in all graphic samples.
  * Java Bug Fix: calling the getNeededNodes() method of a NodeInfo object caused a memory corruption.
  * Gadget: added a dump for the internal state.
  * Gadget: added a callback for connected/disconnected events.
  * NiViewer: Rainbow view now uses a histogram.
  * Android: Fixed the NiSkeletonBenchmark makefile.
  * Gadget: added support for zero size replies (not ready).
  * Bug Fix: when recording, first frames (with timestamp zero) might be recorded several times.
  * NiUserSelection sample bug fix: User might sometime disappear.
  * Added new template containers (XnListT, XnQueueT, XnStackT, XnHashT, XnStringsHashT, XnEventT, XnCyclicQueueT, XnCyclicStackT, XnStringsSet)
  * BC Bug Fix: creating a user generator which was compiled with OpenNI older than 1.3.2 fails.
  * Compilation: all projects now compile with warning level 4.
  * Android Samples: added HandTracker Sample, and improved SamplesAssistant.
  * Upgraded VS solution to VS 2010.
  * Added xnLogGetFileName() method for getting current file name.
  * Fixed some potential (never-gonna-happen) memory leaks.
  * All samples makefiles now first include CommonDefs (so they can use definitions from there).
  * All GLUT samples also link with GL (implicit on Ubuntu, but it seems Fedora requires it).
  * Bug Fix: After a call to xnLogClose(), every module trying to write to log crashes (because xnLogClose destroys all logger objects...)
  * .Net BC Bug Fix: Using context.Shutdown() leaves a bad state. Having a loop of new context and context.Shutdown() will result in an exception: "C# wrapper: creating a Context object wrapping an already wrapped object!"
  * Minor performance improvement: The UpdateAll() method used dynamic allocation of a map of nodes to track which nodes in the graph were updated, and which weren't. Now, instead, a bWasVisited member was added to each node so the same can be achieved without dynamic memory allocation.
  * Minor performance improvement: context stores the player node if created, so no searching should be done during UpdateAll().
  * Bug Fix: Dump system had a static object which was destroyed sometime during shutdown. This cause problems with destructor order. It's now a singleton that never gets freed.
  * Disable copy ctor and assignment operator in old data containers - they were buggy, and nobody was using them anyway...
  * Bug Fix: on Linux, the server would sometime hang when device is closed.
  * C++ Wrappers: Map classes are now defined by templates, instead of ugly macro.
  * Log: adding some verbosity when seeking frames, if default mechanism (seek tables) wasn't used for some reason.
  * .Net Wrappers Bug Fix: calling NodeInfo.NeededNodes causes memory corruption.
  * .Net Wrappers Bug Fix: Query.AddNeededNode() and Query.AddSupportedCapability() does not work (query kept a pointer to marshaled string, which was already destroyed) (#1935)
  * .Net Wrappers: adding a version of Context.EnumerateProductionTrees which does not accept a query.
  * New documentation!
  * Marking global method xn::GetVersion() as deprecated - replaced by Version::Current().
  * Adding getters and setters to Version class.
  * Adding overloads to Query which accepts Version instead of XnVersion.
  * Adding UnitTester (based on gtest and gmock).
  * XnUSB: replacing the connect/disconnect callback with an actual event, that many can use.
  * NiConvertXToONI improvements:
    * Can now copy more than one node.
    * Can choose start/end position in any combination.
    * Progress is shown in percentage (frame count was misleading).
  * Java Wrappers: Fixed a memory leak when using ConvertRealWorldToProjective or ConvertProjectiveToRealWorld.
  * Mock Map Generator: allow data bigger than expected (needed for our recordings, as we record shifts + depth).
  * NiUserTracker sample improvements:
    * Added frameID (Default off, 'f' to toggle)
    * Added circles at all joints (Default off, 'j' to toggle)
    * Added more joints
    * Register to pose callbacks only when pose is actually needed (and available)
  * BuildJava.bat - Use absolute paths (on some machines, the relative ones get too long...)
  * C++ Wrappers: Adding a version of GetContext() which returns the new context object (instead of updating an existing one)
  * ModuleLoader no longer holds the context.
  * Context object now holds C++ objects (improves memory fragmentation and pointer dereference).
  * Adding the 'Node Creation' and the 'Node Destruction' events to the context.
  * C++ Wrappers: Adding equality and inequality operators to the C++ Context class.
  * Support for FrameSync in ONI files.
  * Fixing memory leak - missing delete when closing dump file.
  * Log Bug Fix: starting a new log file would just reset the old one.
  * Log Bug Fix: registering or unregistering a log writer while a log entry is being written might cause a crash.
  * NiUserSelection sample: Only require pose capability if it is required by the generator...
  * Bug Fix: performing a query for creation info longer than 80 bytes failed.

Version 1.5.2.23 (Stable version - Dec 28th 2011)
-------------------------------------------------
  * C++: IRMetaData didn't have operator() and operator[], which is inconsistent with depth and scene.

Version 1.4.0.2 (Unstable version - Nov 17th 2011)
--------------------------------------------------

Version 1.3.4.6 (Unstable version - Nov 7th 2011)
-------------------------------------------------
  * In MockGenerator::SetData, change the node to Generating state so it would be recorded properly.

  * Linux: Switched to newer makefiles. SSE is enabled in debug, always declare sysroot (even for /) so that -I=/usr/include/ni could work properly.
  * Linux: fix cross compilation and add separate scripts to cross compile on specific machine. Also, binary folders are now named according to platform and configuration.
  * Documentation: Added a section about creating modules.
  * Backwards Compatibility Workaround: some old recordings marked nodes as not generating though they contained frames. This resulted in "node is locked" error if trying to start generating them.

--------------------------------------------------
  * Update to newer version of CommonCppMakefile (without the -malign-double flag).

	2. RunXmlScript() was marked deprecated. Now has another overload with takes the script node as output.
	3. RunXmlScriptFromFile() was marked deprecated. Now has another overload with takes the script node as output.

  * XnUSBWin32: Added a EP reset before each read/write/queue command.
  * Fix a playback speed bug where the first frame in the file would always sleep till its timestamp.
  * XnUSBWin32: Fixed a problem where the endpoint set property command did not work on overlapped I/O endpoints.
  * Adding XnBitSet - Holds a set of bits that can be individually get/set 
  * Added XnArray - self-growing array
  * Added General GetData() function to Generator
  * Added ability to expose a general generator with XN_EXPORT_GENERATOR
  * XnProductionNodeType is now defined to be Int32 rather than enum - to support extensions.
  * Fixing seek and playbackSpeed problems. 
  * Making types packed even if no shared libs (types might be used in recordings...)
  * OpenNI: Adding support for platforms which does not have shared libraries.
  * Playback speed: Worked around for bad recordings where timestamps sometimes go backwards.
  * AutoCSLocker - adding copy ctor and operator=. Also adding some asserts to make sure operation succeeded.
  * C++ wrappers: adding GetXCapability() const versions.
  * Bug Fix: played nodes (from recordings) weren't really locked. They remained unlock for creating thread (the thread that called context.Init()).
  * Bug Fix: Seek() did not work properly (it would sometimes go to wrong frame).
  * The linux redist script will now do a full rebuild and also use the gacutil to clean old installs of OpenNI.net
  * Added a new argument to the win32 redist script that allows a full rebuild to be made.
  * The win32 redist script will now use the gacutil to clean old installs of the OpenNI.net wrapper.
  * Bug Fix: trying to play an empty ONI file (no data) results in stack overflow.
  * NiViewer: change default audio capturing format to uncompressed.
  * Better management of timestamps in recordings:
    1. When writing frames, nodes are sorted according to timestamp.
    2. Recorder now holds timestamp of the first data it received. All other timestamps are computer accordingly.
  * NiViewer: adding the option to choose which device to open by using the "-devices" switch.
  * C++ wrappers: making some methods const.
  * NiViewer Bug Fix: start recording with delay recorder while counting back... (this was because once nodes were added, the WaitOneUpdateAll() also called Record()).
  * API fix: Mock nodes SetData() method should take a const MetaData object.
  * Changing default XML file:
    1. Mark image node as stopOnError=false.
    2. Remove resolution. Let vendor decide its defaults.
  * Adding an option to the XML to mark nodes as "stopOnError", which means if they can't be created, the XML script will continue to run.
  * Win32 USB Driver changes:
    1. All refs of PrimeSensor were changed to PrimeSense Sensor
    2. Upgraded the driver from vista (WLH) to windows 7 (Win7) env.
    3. Upgraded the WinDDK from 7600.16385.0 (7.0) to 7600.16385.1 (7.1)
    4. Upgraded dpinst to the latest version.
    5. Added support for isochronous writes.
    6. Changed version from 3.1.0.4 to 3.1.1.0.
  * Fixing C sample to free resources.
  * Bug Fix: DataIndex record would always cause an assertion when the file loops.

Version 1.0.0.25 (Unstable version - Jan 10th 2011)
---------------------------------------------------
  * Fixed a bug in XnUSB-Win32 where it return any USB devices that were associated with the driver and not only the requested VID/PID.
  * Added OpenNI.net samples to Linux redist
  * Renamed OpenNI.dll to OpenNI.net.dll on Linux so it will be the same name as Windows
  * OpenNI.net is now installed to the GAC.
  * Added proper support for OpenNI.net on Linux/Mac.
  * .Net samples: handle errors correctly.
  * Adding icons to C# samples.
  * Added MacOSX platform support.
  * Bug Fix: Xml query for max version checked the min version. 
  * Added the unstable README file.
  * Bug Fix: when using WaitXUpdateAll, the MetaData of a non-updated node would not change its IsDataNew flag.
  * Linux Bug Fix: xnOSCreateProcess() would cause zombie processes.
  * Adding log functions to C# wrapper.
  * Bug Fix: a bug in libusb caused bad calculation of max packet size of an endpoint, resulting in many lost frames in BULK mode.
  * NiViewer Bug Fix: in background removal mode (6), there was no support for cropping, causing a crash.
  * NiViewer Bug Fix on Linux: multiline messages are not displayed properly (they are cut)
  * API change: renamed Ref() and Unref() to AddRef() and Release(). Old functions were left (so that API is not broken), but are marked as deprecated.
  * NiBackRecorder: use MockDepthGenerator.SetData() instead of setting properties
  * MockSetData now doesn't wait, but updates data immediately (this is useful when the synthetic data is with invalid size - no need to wait 2 seconds to get the error).
  * Added validity checks to XnModuleCppRegistratration.h (calling a function without checking if capability is supported might cause a crash).
  * Adding PlaybackSpeed functionality to Player.
  * Adding .net wrappers.
  * C++ wrappers: Make sure NULL callbacks aren't called
  * UserTracker sample: print why enumeration failed.
  * Seek optimization: adding data index to each node in ONI files. The data index is read when file is opened, and seeking can be done a lot faster.
  * XnUSB: added an API for enumerating and opening a sensor by device path.
  * Shared memory bug fix: failed to create shared memory if name contained backslash.
  * C++ wrappers Bug Fix: RegisterToGestureChange would register to pixel format change.  

Version 1.0.0.23 (Stable version - Dec 8th 2010)
------------------------------------------------
  * Initial release...
