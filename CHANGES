Detailed Change log:
--------------------

Version 1.3.2.1 (Stable version - July 4th 2011)
-----------------------------------------------
  * Moved HandTouchingFOVEdge to be a Capability, available through the HandGenerator.
  * Skeleton Capability:
	 - CalibrationCallbacks (bundle of CalibrationStart and CalibrationEnd) marked as deprecated
	 - New callback: CalibrationStart (with RegisterTo/UnregisterFrom) - replacing deprecated CalibrationCallbacks
	 - Removed forceFixedLength, IsForcedFixedLength, SetPostProcessing - not general API. Instead, int property of XnVFeatures
  * Pose Detection Capability
	 - PoseCallbacks (bundle of PoseStart and PoseEnd) marked as deprecated
	 - New callback: PoseDetected (with RegisterTo/UnregisterFrom) - replacing deprecated PoseCallbacks
	 - New callback: OutOfPose (with RegisterTo/UnregisterFrom) - replacing deprecated PoseCallbacks
  * PoseDetectionStatus enum changed, to contain only relevant options
  * All relevant samples use new APIs.
  * Memory leak fix - creating temporary C++ wrapper node objects cause memory leaks.
  * Linux: allowing OpenNI to be installed in a different directory.
  * Linux Bug Fix: logs are not created if log dir does not exist.
  * Removed MessageBoxes from uninstallation process.
  * New Java wrappers and samples!
  * Bug Fix: Exporter singleton functions might be called *after* its destruction (when global objects are destroyed, destruction order is undetermined).
  * Raise the shutdown event *after* all nodes have been destroyed (some nodes might call the context or other nodes when destroying)
  * BugFix: running xml script would startGenerateAll instead of just the ones that were created. NOTE: this also changes behavior so that nodes are now started in the order in which they were written in the script.
  * Changed recorder buffer size to support UXGA with worst case compression.
  * NiViewer bug fix: if no depth when NiViewer starts, scale is never drawn, even if depth is created later on.
  * Initial support for Android.
  * NiConvertXToONI: now when specifying node type in command line, only nodes of that type are converted.
  * Bug Fix: NiSimpleViewer crashes when image node does not exist (#1211).

  * Bug Fix: Create production tree didn't return hNode if already exists.
  * Added option to query for non-existing nodes only
  * Added options to xml script for querying existing nodes and non-existing nodes
  * Added documentation for creating recorder from xml script
  * Added documentation for querying for existing nodes and non-existing nodes through xml
  * UpdateVersion.py now updates version number in doxygen project name

  * Changed GLES to work properly on CE4100.
  * Added virtual to LogWriterBase dtor.
  * Fixed bug in queries - xnIsNodeMatch returned TRUE when there was no match.
  * Added input pointer validation in xnGetModuleNodeHandle().
  * C++ Wrapper Bug Fix: CreateProductionTree would not return created node, so node always had a ref count of at least 1.
  * Log Bug Fix: changing output folder causes file to be created (even if not requested).
  * Bug Fix: xnAddNeededNode() did not add an already added node, but also didn't notify caller. Changed to add it again.
  * Bug Fix: playing ONI files does not work in application using deprecated API.
  * Bug Fix: enumerating with a query might cause a crash.
  * Bug Fix: playing ONI files might cause extra ref count to context.
  * Bug Fix: When an enumeration error occurs in running XML file, trying to access this error causes crash.
  * Ref count dump improvement.
  * API change: running XML scripts is now done via ScriptNode object, and this object is responsible for the lifetime of created objects.
  * API change: from now on, context object works with reference count:
    1. InitFromXml() was marked deprecated. Now has another overload with takes the script node as output.
	2. RunXmlScript() was marked deprecated. Now has another overload with takes the script node as output.
	3. RunXmlScriptFromFile() was marked deprecated. Now has another overload with takes the script node as output.
	4. Shutdown() was marked deprecated. Release() should be used instead (or let dtor do its stuff)
  * Log: adding LogWriter framework. It is now possible to add other log writers (others than console/file).

  * NiViewer: adding the option to choose which device to open by using the "-devices" switch.
  * C++ wrappers: making some methods const.
  * NiViewer Bug Fix: start recording with delay recorder while counting back... (this was because once nodes were added, the WaitOneUpdateAll() also called Record()).

  * Changing default XML file:
    1. Mark image node as stopOnError=false.
    2. Remove resolution. Let vendor decide its defaults.
  * Adding an option to the XML to mark nodes as "stopOnError", which means if they can't be created, the XML script will continue to run.
  * Win32 USB Driver changes:

Version 1.0.0.25 (Unstable version - Jan 10th 2011)
---------------------------------------------------
  * Fixed a bug in XnUSB-Win32 where it return any USB devices that were associated with the driver and not only the requested VID/PID.
  * Added OpenNI.net samples to Linux redist
  * Renamed OpenNI.dll to OpenNI.net.dll on Linux so it will be the same name as Windows
  * OpenNI.net is now installed to the GAC.
  * Added proper support for OpenNI.net on Linux/Mac.
  * .Net samples: handle errors correctly.
  * Adding icons to C# samples.
  * Added MacOSX platform support.
  * Bug Fix: Xml query for max version checked the min version. 
  * Added the unstable README file.
  * Bug Fix: when using WaitXUpdateAll, the MetaData of a non-updated node would not change its IsDataNew flag.
  * Linux Bug Fix: xnOSCreateProcess() would cause zombie processes.
  * Adding log functions to C# wrapper.
  * Bug Fix: a bug in libusb caused bad calculation of max packet size of an endpoint, resulting in many lost frames in BULK mode.
  * NiViewer Bug Fix: in background removal mode (6), there was no support for cropping, causing a crash.
  * NiViewer Bug Fix on Linux: multiline messages are not displayed properly (they are cut)
  * API change: renamed Ref() and Unref() to AddRef() and Release(). Old functions were left (so that API is not broken), but are marked as deprecated.
  * NiBackRecorder: use MockDepthGenerator.SetData() instead of setting properties
  * MockSetData now doesn't wait, but updates data immediately (this is useful when the synthetic data is with invalid size - no need to wait 2 seconds to get the error).
  * Added validity checks to XnModuleCppRegistratration.h (calling a function without checking if capability is supported might cause a crash).
  * Adding PlaybackSpeed functionality to Player.
  * Adding .net wrappers.
  * C++ wrappers: Make sure NULL callbacks aren't called
  * UserTracker sample: print why enumeration failed.
  * Seek optimization: adding data index to each node in ONI files. The data index is read when file is opened, and seeking can be done a lot faster.
  * XnUSB: added an API for enumerating and opening a sensor by device path.
  * Shared memory bug fix: failed to create shared memory if name contained backslash.
  * C++ wrappers Bug Fix: RegisterToGestureChange would register to pixel format change.
