libusb
======

libusb is a library for USB device access from Linux userspace.
It is written in C and licensed under the LGPL-2.1 (see COPYING).

libusb is abstracted internally in such a way that it can hopefully
be ported to other operating systems. See the PORTING file for some
information, if you fancy a challenge :)
